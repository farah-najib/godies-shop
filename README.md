Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building serverless functions.
AWS SDK: Library for interacting with AWS services.
Serverless Framework: A framework for deploying serverless applications.
serverless-iam-roles-per-function: A Serverless Framework plugin for defining IAM roles per function, improving security by minimizing permissions.
Prerequisites

Serverless Framework: Install it globally using npm install -g serverless



serverless-iam-roles-per-function: A Serverless Framework plugin for defining IAM roles per function, improving security by minimizing permissions.



We’ll create six lambda functions:

· 

· 

· create-quiz to create a new tutorial

· update-quiz to update a tutorial

· delete-quiz to delete a tutorial .
  get-quiz to return only one quiz .
  get-all-quiz to return all the quizes in the database .
